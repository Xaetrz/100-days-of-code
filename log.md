# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Project Euler.

**Thoughts** I started the 100 Days of Code as a way of getting back into regular coding and to prepare myself for a job hunt. The exercises on FreeCodeCamp are a way for me to refresh myself on all the web dev basics. Since they're fairly easy to work through, I also am throwing in some coding challenges to complete alongside them to keep me engaged.

### Day 2: February 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many more exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Project Euler.

**Thoughts** I'm wanting to go through at least 1 course and 1 challenge each day on work days like today. This seems practical without being overwhelming time-wise and memory-wise.
