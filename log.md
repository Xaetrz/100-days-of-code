# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Project Euler.

**Thoughts** I started the 100 Days of Code as a way of getting back into regular coding and to prepare myself for a job hunt. The exercises on FreeCodeCamp are a way for me to refresh myself on all the web dev basics. Since they're fairly easy to work through, I also am throwing in some coding challenges to complete alongside them to keep me engaged.

### Day 2: February 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many more exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Project Euler.

**Thoughts** I'm wanting to go through at least 1 course and 1 challenge each day on work days like today. This seems practical without being overwhelming time-wise and memory-wise.

### Day 3: February 26, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 4 Project Euler challenges.

**Thoughts** I planned on completing another course from FreeCodeCamp tonight, but I shifted my sleep schedule back by ~8 hours for work/family reasons. I'm so drowsy that I don't think I'd retain much info which would defeat the point. I still completed the challenges since that's a matter of problem-solving rather than learning/memorization.

### Day 4: February 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many more exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Project Euler.

**Thoughts** I completed 2 courses today to make up for yesterday and completed a couple Euler exercises. For the courses, I have a certification project next so I will complete that instead of a normal course tomorrow. I'm still aiming for a minimum of 1 Euler exercise a day. (I work late nights and sleep in the afternoon. So depending on whether I complete exercices before or after work, there could be some weirdness on what day I completed something. For instance, I completed "yesterday's" exercises Monday night and today's exercises Wednesday morning, but that's effectively the next day for me at the moment.)

### Day 6: March 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a course. Worked on problem 12 of Project Euler, couldn't finish in time

**Thoughts** I spent an embarassing amount of time trying to create a function that efficiently counts the number of divisors. The brute force method for the challenge was way too inefficient. I was mostly trying to work out the math involved in calculating this using prime factorization. My code seems correct but it doesn't work and I'm running on empty at the moment. I'll come back to it tomorrow, hopefully when I'm better rested.

### Day 7: March 2, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a course. Solved problems 12 and 13 of Project Euler

**Thoughts** Finally solved problem 12. I greatly overcomplicated things with counting the number of divisors. Managed to work out how to do it with prime factorization, but it wasn't really necessary. Beyond that, I was still running into a baffling performance problem with the triangular number calculation. My solution performed poorly when I was incorrectly counting the sequence of triangle numbers (I accidentally started by adding 1 to 1 instead of 2). I never thought fixing that would cause it to perform much better, but it seems to be some kind of property of triangular numbers that finding the minimum triangular number with 500+ divisors is much faster than with my buggy calculation of the triangle numbers. That sent me on a wild goose chase to find a more efficient way of doing the problem instead of fixing the bug. Frustrating but yet another lesson to avoid optimization before solving the problem at hand.

### Day 8: March 3, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Partially completed a course. Solved problems 14 and 15 of Project Euler

**Thoughts** Problem 14 was very simple, but for problem 15, I decided to deep-dive into some quirks of javascript after running into a performance problem with my initial recursive solution. I realized pretty early that memoizing the arguments of my recursive function would speed it up (substantially, in fact). It took me awhile to figure out why my memoize function wrapper wasn't working but I worked it out (the fact that the wrapper was only called once should have been a major clue to figure out what was happening earlier). I looked up some alternative solutions after the fact, there was also a discrete math solution. I figured this was the case at the start, but discrete math is my rustiest subject and I intend to refresh myself on it as I go along.

### Day 11: March 6, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved problem 19 of Project Euler

**Thoughts** This exercise from Project Euler seemed like a good interview question to solve. Took longer to solve than I would have liked, but it was also under less than ideal physical circumstances (had to wake up early, completed after tiring work day).

### Day 12: March 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Solved problem 17 of Project Euler

**Thoughts** This problem involved converting a number into its word form. I wanted to challenge myself with creating a function that did this without a bunch of hard-coded if-then branches (e.g. if between 1 and 10, else if between 11 and 20, etc.). And that's what I did, as silly as it was. This was also why I skipped this problem the last couple days, since I was way too tired to handle it.

### Day 13: March 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a course. Completed problem 20 and worked on part of problem 21 of Project Euler

**Thoughts** No issues with problem 21 so far, just don't have enough time to finish it. The next section in the course is a project, so I will complete that and the rest of problem 21 tomorrow.

### Day 14: March 9, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed problem 21 of Project Euler

**Thoughts** Having misunderstood what the problem was asking me to do, I spent a good amount of time solving the wrong thing. Thankfully, I figured it out soon after.
