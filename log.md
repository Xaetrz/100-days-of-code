# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Project Euler.

**Thoughts** I started the 100 Days of Code as a way of getting back into regular coding and to prepare myself for a job hunt. The exercises on FreeCodeCamp are a way for me to refresh myself on all the web dev basics. Since they're fairly easy to work through, I also am throwing in some coding challenges to complete alongside them to keep me engaged.

2. Solved and committed first 3 exercises in Project Euler: https://github.com/Xaetrz/ProjectEuler


### Day 2: February 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many more exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Project Euler.

**Thoughts** I'm wanting to go through at least 1 course and 1 challenge each day on work days like today. This seems practical without being overwhelming time-wise and memory-wise.

### Day 3: February 26, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 4 Project Euler challenges.

**Thoughts** I planned on completing another course from FreeCodeCamp tonight, but I shifted my sleep schedule back by ~8 hours for work/family reasons. I'm so drowsy that I don't think I'd retain much info which would defeat the point. I still completed the challenges since that's a matter of problem-solving rather than learning/memorization.

### Day 4: February 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many more exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Project Euler.

**Thoughts** I completed 2 courses today to make up for yesterday and completed a couple Euler exercises. For the courses, I have a certification project next so I will complete that instead of a normal course tomorrow. I'm still aiming for a minimum of 1 Euler exercise a day. (I work late nights and sleep in the afternoon. So depending on whether I complete exercices before or after work, there could be some weirdness on what day I completed something. For instance, I completed "yesterday's" exercises Monday night and today's exercises Wednesday morning, but that's effectively the next day for me at the moment.)

### Day 5: February 29, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the first certification project for Responsive Web Design and completed a Project Euler exercise.

**Thoughts** None.

### Day 6: March 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a course. Worked on problem 12 of Project Euler, couldn't finish in time

**Thoughts** I spent an embarassing amount of time trying to create a function that efficiently counts the number of divisors. The brute force method for the challenge was way too inefficient. I was mostly trying to work out the math involved in calculating this using prime factorization. My code seems correct but it doesn't work and I'm running on empty at the moment. I'll come back to it tomorrow, hopefully when I'm better rested.
