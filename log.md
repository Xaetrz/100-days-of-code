# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Project Euler.

**Thoughts** I started the 100 Days of Code as a way of getting back into regular coding and to prepare myself for a job hunt. The exercises on FreeCodeCamp are a way for me to refresh myself on all the web dev basics. Since they're fairly easy to work through, I also am throwing in some coding challenges to complete alongside them to keep me engaged.

### Day 2: February 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many more exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Project Euler.

**Thoughts** I'm wanting to go through at least 1 course and 1 challenge each day on work days like today. This seems practical without being overwhelming time-wise and memory-wise.

### Day 3: February 26, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 4 Project Euler challenges.

**Thoughts** I planned on completing another course from FreeCodeCamp tonight, but I shifted my sleep schedule back by ~8 hours for work/family reasons. I'm so drowsy that I don't think I'd retain much info which would defeat the point. I still completed the challenges since that's a matter of problem-solving rather than learning/memorization.

### Day 4: February 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many more exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Project Euler.

**Thoughts** I completed 2 courses today to make up for yesterday and completed a couple Euler exercises. For the courses, I have a certification project next so I will complete that instead of a normal course tomorrow. I'm still aiming for a minimum of 1 Euler exercise a day. (I work late nights and sleep in the afternoon. So depending on whether I complete exercices before or after work, there could be some weirdness on what day I completed something. For instance, I completed "yesterday's" exercises Monday night and today's exercises Wednesday morning, but that's effectively the next day for me at the moment.)

### Day 5: February 29, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the first certification project for Responsive Web Design and completed a Project Euler exercise.

**Thoughts** None.
